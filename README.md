# Description

In this notebook, we will explore the **Medical Cost Personal Datasets** to build a predictive model that estimates individual medical costs based on personal and demographic features. The dataset includes features such as:

- **Age**  
- **Sex**  
- **BMI**  
- **Number of Children**  
- **Smoking Status**  
- **Region**  

Our objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the charges for each individual, which can help in understanding medical cost patterns and creating better insurance plans.

## Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean the data  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Perform feature engineering  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize and analyze the relationships between features  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Build predictive models including:  
     - **Linear Regression**  
     - **Lasso**  
     - **Ridge**  
     - **Polynomial Regression**  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics  
   - Select the best-performing model
